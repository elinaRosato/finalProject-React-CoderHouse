<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

I'm a huge lover of porridge and all oat-based meals. This is why I decided to create a web app where you could find all oat-related recipes and products. Some features I would like to include are:

* Be able to find oat-realated recipes.
* Buy all the needed ingredients to recreate them.
* Suscribe to a newsletter to recieve new recipes weekly.
* Suscribe to a monthly porridge box where you'd revieve a printed recipe and all the needed ingredients to recreate it.
* Save favourites recipes and products.
* Sort recipes and products by category.

This project is still in the building phase. I'm contantly finding new features to imporve it so if you have any idea please leave me a message :)
